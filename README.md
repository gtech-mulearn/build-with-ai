# Autonomous Supply Chain Control Tower

> AI-powered real-time logistics simulation with autonomous rerouting, disruption management, and Gemini-generated insights.

---

## Problem Statement

Supply chain operations teams have no real-time visibility into fleet movement across a road network, and no fast mechanism to model how disruptions (accidents, weather, traffic jams) cascade into delivery delays. Manual rerouting is slow, reactive, and error-prone — costing time and money.

---

## Project Description

The **Autonomous Supply Chain Control Tower** is a full-stack real-time logistics platform that simulates a fleet of 6 autonomous freight vehicles navigating the Kerala, India road network. The system:

- **Continuously monitors** all vehicles on a live animated Google Maps dashboard
- **Autonomously reroutes** vehicles when route risk exceeds a configurable threshold — using a GA → A* → Dijkstra fallback chain
- **Injects disruptions** (accidents, weather, traffic jams, stress tests) via a point-and-click map interface
- **Explains every decision** in plain English using the Google Gemini AI API
- **Broadcasts live state** to all connected clients over WebSocket at 200ms intervals

The result is an AI-powered command center where operators can observe, simulate, and understand complex logistics scenarios in real time.

## Google AI Usage

### Tools / Models Used
- **Google Gemini API** — `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`
- **Google Maps JavaScript API** — live map rendering
- **Google Directions API** — real road geometry for vehicle paths

### How Google AI Was Used

Gemini is integrated directly into the simulation engine's **autonomous decision loop**:

1. **Reroute Explanations** — Every time a vehicle is autonomously rerouted due to high risk, Gemini generates a 2-sentence technical explanation referencing the specific vehicle ID, risk score, algorithm used, and road names. This appears in the live AI Insights panel.

2. **Disruption Analysis** — When an operator injects a disruption (e.g. ACCIDENT on KALADY↔ALUVA), Gemini provides a situational awareness update describing which roads are affected, which vehicles are impacted, and what rerouting action is being taken.

3. **Rate-Limited & Resilient** — A custom rate limiter enforces a 45-second cooldown between calls and a 5-minute deduplication window per event. On quota errors (429), the system parses the retry delay and falls back to rich pre-written explanations — the simulation never crashes or stalls.
